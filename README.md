### 2. Create a New Branch for Your Changes

Before making any changes, create a new branch to keep your work organized and separate from the main branch.

```bash
git checkout -b add-audit2allow-page
```
*Replace `add-audit2allow-page` with a descriptive name for your branch.*

---

### 3. Write or Update a Command Page

1. **Find the correct directory**: Navigate to the appropriate directory depending on the platform the command applies to (`linux`, `osx`, `windows`, etc.). For example:
   ```bash
   cd pages/linux
   ```

2. **Create a new Markdown file**: The file should be named after the command you're documenting. For example:
   ```bash
   touch audit2allow.md
   ```

3. **Write the command page**: The format for the command page should follow the TLDR guidelines, typically consisting of:
   - A brief description of the command.
   - A link to official documentation.
   - At most 8 examples of how to use the command.

#### Example:

```markdown
# audit2allow

> Create an SELinux local policy module to allow rules based on denied operations found in logs.
> More information: <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/audit2allow.1.html>.

- Generate and install a local policy to allow access for all denied services:

`sudo audit2allow --all -M {{local_policy_name}} && sudo semodule -i {{local_policy_name}}.pp`

- Generate and install a local policy module to grant access to a specific service from the audit logs:

`sudo grep {{apache2}} /var/log/audit/audit.log | sudo audit2allow -M {{local_policy_name}} && sudo semodule -i {{local_policy_name}}.pp`

- View the Type Enforcement (.te) file for a local policy:

`cat {{local_policy_name}}.te`
```

---

### 4. Lint the Page

Before committing, run the TLDR linter to ensure the page meets the required formatting and syntax.

1. Install `tldr-lint`:
   ```bash
   npm install --global tldr-lint
   ```

2. Run the linter on your page:
   ```bash
   tldr-lint pages/linux/audit2allow.md
   ```

If there are no errors, you can proceed. If errors appear, fix them and re-run the linter.

---

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

Once your changes are complete and verified with the linter, commit the changes:

1. **Add your file**:
   ```bash
   git add pages/linux/audit2allow.md
   ```

2. **Commit with a meaningful message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "audit2allow: add page"
   ```

3. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-audit2allow-page
   ```

---

### 6. Create a Pull Request (PR)
